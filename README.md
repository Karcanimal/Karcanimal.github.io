I enrolled in the Computer Science program at SNHU in March 2021 with the initial goal of securing advancement opportunities in the Army. 
While I initially chose this program due to the job prospects it offered, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of software development courses it included.
As I delved into programming fundamentals, I found myself thoroughly enjoying the classes and discovering the myriad of skills that were directly applicable to my role as a Radio Technician.

Throughout the program, I’ve honed my attention to detail, logical thinking, troubleshooting, and computer literacy skills. Moreover, I’ve developed the ability to create comprehensive project plans and effectively interpret customer requirements. 
The coursework has equipped me with proficiency in programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, Python, and C++, empowering me to tackle various challenges in my professional domain.

In my role as a Radio Technician, the knowledge gained from the program has proven invaluable. Understanding the fundamentals of digital communication systems has enhanced my ability to comprehend how systems encode, decode, and implement encryption algorithms. 
Additionally, my grasp of software-defined radio architecture has positioned me ahead of my peers, enabling me to interpret and optimize system performance effectively.

One of the most significant takeaways from the program has been the skill to sift through vast amounts of data generated by LMR systems and distill it into actionable insights. 
This capability has enabled me to generate useful reports that enhance overall system performance and contribute to mission success.

Looking ahead, I am eager to continue leveraging the skills and knowledge acquired from the program to further advance in my career. 
Whether it’s pursuing advanced certifications or exploring leadership opportunities, I am confident that the foundation laid by the Computer Science program will continue to propel me towards achieving my goals.

I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science 
by implementing the addition of industry standards and descriptive header comments that describe the class in depth.The header comments allow for a team of developers to easily understand the class 
and edit it to introduce new functionality to the application or troubleshoot existing issues with the code base. 

I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communication that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences 
by completing the informal code review and ensuring that the industry standards are compliant to ensure that the team of developers can understand and interpret the code base. With the completion of these enhancements, 
it allows for a clear line of communication that improves the overall productivity of the team along with the exact thoughts of the developer that originally created the code base. 

I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs 
involved in design choices by implementing the addition of the flexible data structure and the other methods that were required to fully implement this addition. The addition of the flexible data structure confirms the completion of a 
successfully designed computer science practice that incorporates various layers of implementation. From the addition of the code base that supports the function to the user interface that allows the user to interact with the backend.

I have also demonstrated the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value 
and accomplish industry-specific goals by implementing the reworking the code base and properly separating the classes into their own individual files,
implementing a logging mechanism, adhering to proper industry standards, addition of the flexible data structure, and import and export of csv functions and the filter function. 

I have developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and design to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by completing the 
implementation of the addition of the encryption algorithms to the databases by adding a hashing method to encrypt the user’s login information. Also, by adhering to security standards by using anti-SQL injection techniques to prevent unwanted database manipulation.
